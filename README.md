# Steven Cusey Projects
Here are some of my favorite projects I've worked on, both solo and group projects are included here, whether I did them for school or for fun. Each folder contains the code code for the project, as well as a video demonstrating it.

# Project 1: Your Jet Ski Our Spotlight | C#, MySql, Microsoft Azure
This is a group project I worked on for school with my classmate Damien Padilla. He coded the Jet Ski Page as well as the functionality to add, remove, or edit a jet Ski. I meanwhile, was reponsible for the registration and Login Pages, as well as putting the program in Microsoft Azure. This project uses C# as its primary prgramming language, MySql to store the list of Jet Skis, and Azure as its cloud platform.
