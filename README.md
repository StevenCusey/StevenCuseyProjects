This is a group project I worked on for school with my classmate Damien Padilla. He coded the Jet Ski Page as well as the functionality to add, remove, or edit a jet Ski. I meanwhile, was reponsible for the registration and login Pages, as well as putting the program in Microsoft Azure. This project uses C# as its primary prgramming language, MySql to store the list of Jet Skis, and Azure as its cloud platform. Here is a video demonstrating it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1ztp9I3WBM

# Project 2: Namer App | Flutter, Dart | Solo Project for Fun
This is a small Flutter App I built in my free time that generates two random words, then allows the user to temporarily save them to a list. Here is a video demonstrating it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nI1HoIvdg

# Project 3: Personal Page | HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript | Solo Project for School
Here is a personal page I started for school that uses CSS for the theming, HTML for the main layout, and Bootstrap for the NavBar. Here is a video demonstrating it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaoHdWWfT78

# Project 4: Gluten Freeway | Dart, Flutter, MongoDB | Possibly Make it into a Commercial Product
