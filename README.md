# Steven Cusey Favorite Projects
Here are some of my favorite projects I've worked on, both solo and group projects are included here, whether I did them for school or for fun. Each folder above contains the code code for the project, and a video and description for each project are in the ReadMe file below. 

# Project 1: Your Jet Ski Our Spotlight | C#, MySql, Microsoft Azure | Group Project for School
This is a group project I worked on for school with my classmate Damien Padilla. He coded the Jet Ski Page as well as the functionality to add, remove, or edit a jet Ski. I meanwhile, was reponsible for the registration and Login Pages, as well as putting the program in Microsoft Azure. This project uses C# as its primary prgramming language, MySql to store the list of Jet Skis, and Azure as its cloud platform. Here is a video demonstrating it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1ztp9I3WBM

# Project 2: Namer App | Flutter, Dart | Solo Project for Fun
This is a small Flutter App I built in my free time that generates two random words, then allows the user to temporarily save them to a list. Here is a video demonstrating it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nI1HoIvdg

# Project 3: Personal Page | HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript | Solo Project for School
Here is a personal page I started for school that uses CSS for the theming, HTML for the main layout, and Bootstrap for the NavBar. Here is a video demonstrating it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaoHdWWfT78

# Keep an eye out here for future projects. I am currently creating an app that allows users to find and naviagate to Gluten-Free restaurants, making things easier for people with celiac disease and other gluten-related diseases.
